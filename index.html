                    <p>I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Florida Institute of Technology. With degrees in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Systems Design Engineering, I spent four years at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health to work in multidisciplinary research environments where I gained successful experience to address interdisciplinary problems in engineering, medicine, and biology. My research interest lies at the interface of statistical modeling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, pattern recognition, digital signal and image processing, biostatistics, and computer vision with applications to climate change, cancer research, and public health. I have more than 100 peer reviewed journal and conference publications. I served as mentor and adviser for undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard and Florida Tech and have been working with undergraduate and graduate students since joining Florida Tech in 2012. More than 50 undergraduate students have performed research under my supervision and presented their work in annual Northrop Grumman Showcase. I helped with Florida Tech’s Biomath <a href="https://research.fit.edu/smag-reu/">REU site</a> as mentor from 2015 to 2017 & I was the PI (Principal Investigator) of the Florida Tech’s REU site in Statistical Models with Applications to Geoscience from 2020 to 2024. Seven (7) of my PhD students have successfully completed their dissertation, graduated, and are working in academia. Currently I have two Postdocs, six PhD, two Masters, and four Undergraduate students who are conducting research under my supervision.</p>

                <p>This course describes how to make predictions or inference regarding the problem at
                    hand using available data. It presents algorithms, techniques, and applications of machine
                    learning mainly through regression analysis at an advanced level. The main goal of
                    machine learning is extracting and gaining useful information from data for prediction and
                    inference. We study two main problem categories addressed in machine learning:
                    1. Classification,
                    2. Regression.
                    The classification problem is to predict what class an instance of data belongs to, while
                    regression problem is to predict a numeric value of a response variable. Classification
                    deals with predicting the class label, which is a discrete value, whereas regression deals
                    with predicting a continuous value for the response to a set of factors.</p>

                    <h3>Segmentation of Glacier Area Using U-Net through Landsat Satellite Imagery</h3>
                    <p>Glaciers are receding globally. Satellite imagery helps quantify these changes, as glaciers are vital freshwater sources and climate change indicators. Deep learning models can segment glacier boundaries but often require large, manually curated datasets. We propose a deep learning method to segment Landsat images of the Mount Cook/Aoraki massif, achieving 92% accuracy in identifying permanent ice and snow. This method offers potential for automated glacier monitoring.</p>

Assessing glacier retreat rates is crucial for understanding climate change impacts and water security. This research proposes a multivariate regression model to estimate glacier changes and predict glacier terminus locations over time based on climate factors.

                    <p>Grouping the objects based on their similarities is an important common task in machine learning applications.
                        Kernel k-means projects the elements to a higher dimensional feature space using a kernel function, and then groups them. Different kernel functions may not perform similarly in clustering of a data set and, in turn, choosing the right kernel for an application could be challenging.</p>

                    <h3>Generalized Additive Models for Predicting Sea Level Rise in Coastal Florida</h3>
                    <p> Projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) show the global mean sea level (GMSL) rise may increase to up to 1 m (1000 mm) by 2100. The primary cause of the sea level rise can be attributed to climate change through the thermal expansion of seawater and the recession of glaciers from melting. Because of the complexity of the climate and environmental systems, it is very difficult to accurately predict the increase in sea level.</p>

                    <p>The Living Docks restoration program was implemented in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, with the goal of affixing oyster restoration mats to dock pilings to promote the growth of filter feeding benthic organisms which can help improve local water quality. This study investigates the presence of benthic organisms on eight Living Docks which were deployed throughout the central part of the IRL. </p>

                    <h3>A probabilistic cell model in background corrected image sequences for single cell analysis</h3>
                    <p>Methods of manual cell localization and outlining are so onerous that automated tracking methods would seem mandatory for handling huge image sequences, nevertheless manual tracking is, astonishingly, still widely practiced in areas such as cell biology which are outside the influence of most image processing research. The goal of our research is to address this gap by developing automated methods of cell tracking, localization, and segmentation.
